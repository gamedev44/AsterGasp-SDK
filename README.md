## 🌟 Project Vision
We're building a flexible, **modular SDK** that will be used across all of our future game titles. This framework is not meant for general public use just yet but is intended to empower creators who want to add to or modify the core experiences of our games.

- 🎯 **Goal**: To establish a shared base for modding and content expansion across our ever expanding community.
- 🛠️ **Focus**: Flexibility, modularity, and ease of use for creating new gamemodes, features, user generated content, mods and more.
